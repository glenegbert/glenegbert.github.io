As with programming, blogging for me is an iterative process. This is my second programming blog and I wrote several blogs in my previous career as an educational coach/trainer.  So as I’m getting started with this version of my blogging efforts, I wanted to define for myself, and hopefully some readers, why it is I’m writing a blog in the first place.

Here’s what I came up with:


_Reflection_ - blogging helps me think retrospectively about what it is I’m working on and if it’s interesting enough to blog about! It also helps me think about the processes I’m using and how they could be better.  This in turn helps me improve as a developer and as a person moving forward.

_Share what I’m doing_ - As a developer and a person I’m constantly using free resources on the web to find solutions.  Hopefully, as a blogger I can contribute something that others will find useful.

_Finding a good work-life match_ - I’m currently seeking employment and my goal is to find a company that I’m a good fit with.  Hopefully any prospective employers will use this blog as a window into what I do and how I work.
